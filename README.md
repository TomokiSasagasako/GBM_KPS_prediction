# **MRI feature extraction and KPS prediction**

### This repository hosts the code for our publication, "Postoperative Karnofsky Performance Status Prediction in Patients with IDH Wild-Type Glioblastoma: A Multimodal Approach Integrating Clinical and Deep Imaging Features." Specifically, it contains the variational autoencoders utilized for extracting MRI imaging features, as well as the neural network-based KPS prediction model.
